I want to test the accuracy and robustness varying cross different numbers of training samples,
though a great deal of works has already demonstrated the increasing accuracy and robustness with more training samples.

## Usage


    python STD.py cifar cifar10 --nums=100
    python AT.py cifar cifar10 --nums=100 -wd=0.0005 -lp=default --epochs=110
